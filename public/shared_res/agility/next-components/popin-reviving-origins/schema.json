At the forefront was close access to clean water. Asili’s monitored water kiosks prevent deadly illnesses like cholera and allow women and girls to spend days in school or at work instead of gathering water from contaminated sources. Last year, Asili provided 41M liters of water through its six zones. Nespresso’s partnership will add two zones by 2022, and by 2023, Asili is on track to serve 500,000 people daily.</p><p>Photo credit : Eastern Congo Initiative</p>",

Asili’s monitored water kiosks prevent deadly illnesses like cholera and allow women and girls to spend days in school or at work instead of gathering water from contaminated sources. Last year, Asili provided 41M liters of water through its six zones. Nespresso’s partnership will add two zones by 2022, and by 2023, Asili is on track to serve 500,000 people daily.</p><p>Photo credit : Eastern Congo Initiative</p>",
